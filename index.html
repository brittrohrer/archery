                    <h3>What is Strait to the Point Archery?</h3>
                    <p>We are a non profit archery education center founded in 2005 by Giap Nguyen.    
                    Straight to the Point Archery has an excellent network of contacts with the USA Archery (USAA), Washington State Archery Association (WSAA), 
                    Washington State Bow Hunters (WSB), National Field Archery Association (NFAA) and many more national and state archery associations. These partnerships allow you to feel confident in our facility and staff.
                    Straight to the Point Archery’s staff has decades of experience in the archery industry. We are committed to educating you with any questions that you may have.</p>
                    <p>Giap Nguyen started Straight to the Point Archery in 2005. He's an avid and accomplished archer himself, having competed with the United States Archery Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics. He has three children, 
                    and started Straight to the Point in part because he was not satisfied with the archery eduction options for them in Tacoma. After The Hunger Games books and movies came out, he noticed a surge in popularity of archery among young people, especially young women, and the business has been booming ever since.
